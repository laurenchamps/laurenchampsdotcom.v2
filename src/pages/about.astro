          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>I''</p>
          <p>Solving problems and learning new things is something I've always loved to do. As a kid ..</p>
          <p>
            As an adult, I've gone where my curiosity has taken me - I worked for 15 years in universities and it was
            there that I discovered my knack for working with systems. Before starting my own business, I built up
            experience from 15+ years the higher education sector. A common thread running through these roles was
            always being the one who knew how things worked, the Excel wizard, the one who was good with that new bit of
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my life I have been driven by curiosity – not one to be defined by any job role, I've sought to
            find opportunities to keep learning, to develop skills, and to use those skills in a meaningful way. Helping
            small business owners achieve their goals gives me a huge sense of satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            This curiosity is not confined to my work life – when I'm not at my laptop you can often find me sewing,
            knitting, reading or out exploring the world around me on a bushwalk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why do I do it? because I want you to succeed and I love nothing more than getting stuck into systems,
            building automations, and creating order from chaos.
          </p>

          I'm a personal, down-to-earth and approachable introvert. There's no shiny veneer - what you see is what you
          get.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Resourceful</h3>
        <p>
          I'm good at identifying problems and coming up with practical solutions. I'm adaptable, open to new ideas and
          always seeking new knowledge and better ways of working.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Prudent</h3>
        <p>
          I do things properly and don't cut corners. That doesn't mean I'm not efficient. But I'm not going to
          sacrifice quality for speed. I take a measured approach and have your long-term success in mind.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Dependable</h3>
        <p>
          I'm with you every step of the way, committed to your success and always ready to roll up my sleeves and get
          to work.
