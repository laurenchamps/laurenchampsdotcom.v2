            A broken process is the kind of thing that keeps me up at night. Yep, I'm that person. If there's a problem
            to be solved, I'll be trying to solve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a generalist at heart, and if you check out my background and qualifications (scroll down), you'll see
            that I've got a varied set of skills and experiences. That comes from a lifetime of being curious and going
            where that takes me. My love of learning means I've built a lot of skills - from coding to teaching and
            plenty in between - and this all comes in handy supporting small business owners where no two days are the
            same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning new skills, building and fixing things aren't confined to my work life - when I'm not on my laptop
            you'll likely find me making my own clothes with a sewing machine or knitting needles, heading out on a
            bushwalk or relaxing with a cup of tea and a good book.

          I'm a personal, down-to-earth and approachable introvert. There's no shiny veneer - what you see is what you
          get.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Resourceful</h3>
        <p>
          I'm good at identifying problems and coming up with practical solutions. I'm adaptable, open to new ideas and
          always seeking new knowledge and better ways of working.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Prudent</h3>
        <p>
          I do things properly and don't cut corners. That doesn't mean I'm not efficient. But I'm not going to
          sacrifice quality for speed. I take a measured approach and have your long-term success in mind.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium">Dependable</h3>
        <p>
          I'm with you every step of the way, committed to your success and always ready to roll up my sleeves and get
          to work.
