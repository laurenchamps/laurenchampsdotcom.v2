          <!-- <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is systemisation and do I need it?" open>
            <p>
              Systemisation is simply creating a system. In relation to your business, it's about creating systems to
              streamline your operations, improve efficiency and ultimately save you time & effort (and money!). It
              involves looking at what you do and how you do it, documenting existing processes, standardising tasks and
              identifying where you can either automate, delegate, or in some cases actually stop doing a task if it's
              not adding value. It may involve introducing new software or tools, and if we're working together it will
              always involve centering you and how you like to work.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem> -->
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is automation?">
            <p>
              Automation, in the context I'm using it, means taking something that you or your team currently do
              manually, and making it happen automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this, we create rules that tell a piece of software, 'when this happens, do that', e.g. 'when a
              form is submitted, send an email'. There are many ways to implement automations, including advanced
              automations using APIs, webhooks and scripting. In most cases, I'll use 'no-code' or 'low-code' tools
              which are easier for you to maintain on an ongoing basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Automation may incorporate AI tools if you're using them, but AI isn't an essential part of this process.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How much does it cost?">
            <p>
              The cost of streamlining your business operations varies depending on the size and complexity of your
              business, your goals, and where you're at right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I offer a range of services to meet you where you are right now. From ad hoc VA (virtual assistant)
              support to systems audits and CRM implementation and everything in between. Systems and automation work I
              generally need to custom quote based on the scope, so please reach out for a chat and we can see what may
              be possible within your budget. For general VA services, my rates are between $45 and $65 per hour
              depending on the number of hours you require per month.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What makes you different from other VAs?">
            <p>
              I have a strong technical background, having undertaken foundational studies in computer science and web
              development. I'm also not affiliated with any particular software products, so if I make recommendations
              to you, they'll be based on my research as well as experience using a range of platforms, with a focus on
              how well they suit your requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter what stage you are at in your business, or how much chaos you feel is going on in behind the
              scenes, you won't get any judgment from me - just a genuine desire to help.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem
            name="exclusive"
            title="Can you help if I already have a CRM/other platform in place but it's not working out as well as I'd hoped?"
          >
            <p>
              Sure can. It's tempting to think that the latest software or tool that everyone's talking about is going
              to turn your chaos into order and have you living your business dreams. And maybe it will. But it doesn't
              always work like that. No software is perfect, and the tool is only one part - you also have to learn it,
              set it up optimally, fit it in with your other platforms and have systems in place to keep everything
              running smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're struggling with a new tool, or looking for a refresh with something you've been using for a
              while, I can help you make some tweaks to your existing setup to get you back on track.

            super efficient, skilled & forward thinking as Lauren.
          </p>
          <p>
            From web design to launches, resource and course creation to general admin, client communication and beyond,
            Lauren handles many facets of my business now. I feel incredibly supported by Lauren, she just gets it!”

        </Testimonial>
        <Testimonial name="Honey Atkinson" title="Photographer + film maker">
          <p>
            “Working with Lauren has been a game-changer for my business. As a one-woman operation, I’d been wanting to
            improve my client experience but was struggling without proper systems in place. Lauren created a complete
            CRM setup tailored to my photography and video work, and it’s completely changed how I operate. Everything
            feels smoother, more professional, and more sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
            She also put together clear SOPs so I can confidently manage things myself, and she sorted out a bunch of
            small tech issues I’d been avoiding. Her communication is always clear and timely, and she’s great at
            explaining things without jargon. I’ve really appreciated her transparency throughout the process — I always
            know where things are at and what’s coming next.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lauren’s brain works at a high level in all the areas mine doesn’t! It’s such a relief to work with someone
            who can see the big picture clearly, especially when I tend to get caught up in the small details — as so
            many of us do when running a business. She’s warm, honest, and incredibly easy to work with. It’s been
            amazing having someone with her skills on hand, without the need to bring on permanent staff.”
