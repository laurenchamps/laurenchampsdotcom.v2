          I can take a look at your current processes and identify any bottlenecks, double-handling and opportunities to

        </Feature>
        <Feature name="screen-code" title="System setup">
          If you're looking to implement a new tool in your business (such as a CRM) but are feeling a bit overwhelmed
          by the technical side of it or just don't have the time to set it up, I can do it for you or with you.
        </Feature>
        <Feature name="lightning" title="Automation">
          Spend less time on repetitive tasks by automating using native automation features in your existing tools, or
          connecting with third-party tools like Make or Zapier.
        </Feature>
        <Feature name="books" title="Documentation">
          Do your processes only exist in your head? I'll help you lighten the mental load by creating a set of
          lightweight guides that document what you do, how you do it, and when to take action.
        </Feature>
        <Feature name="canvas" title="Training">
          If you're struggling to use some of your existing tools or feel like you could be getting more out of them if
          you knew a bit more. I have experience with Notion, Asana, Squarespace, Google Workspace, Kajabi, Zapier,
          Make, Sprout Studio and more.

          If you can never seem to get on top of your to-do list, let me take some of the load. Whether it's website
          updates, file storage, inbox management, document creation, email campaigns or other support for your
          day-to-day operations, I've got you. I cover all this in my VA (virtual assistant) support packages.

          I love helping purpose-led business owners... I'm a generalist at heart, always exploring new tools and
          learning new skills. It's this nature that means I thrive getting to know you and your unique business, and
          looking for solutions that will work for you.

          Before starting out on my own, I spent over a decade in the higher education sector, from student support to
          working with research systems and databases to creating websites. The common thread through all my work has
          been a desire to make digital solutions simpler for the people who use them.

            <p>
              Systemisation is simply creating a system. In relation to your business, it's about creating systems to
              streamline your operations, improve efficiency and ultimately save you time & effort (and money!). It
              involves looking at what you do and how you do it, documenting existing processes, standardising tasks and
              identifying where you can either automate, outsource, or in some cases actually stop doing a task if it's
              not adding value. It may involve introducing new software or tools, and if we're working together it will
              always involve centering you and how you like to work.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is automation? Is that like AI?">
            <p>
              Automation, in the context I'm using it, means taking something that you or your team currently do
              manually, and making it happen automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this automation, we create rules that tell a piece of software, 'when this happens, do that',
              e.g. 'when a form is submitted, send an email'. There are many ways to implement automations, including
              advanced automations using APIs, webhooks and scripting. In most cases, I'll use 'no-code' or 'low-code'
              tools which are easier for you to maintain on an ongoing basis.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How much do systemisation and automation services cost?">
            <p>
              The cost of streamlining your business operations varies depending on the size and complexity of your
              business, your goals, and where you're at right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I offer a range of services to meet you where you are right now. From ad hoc VA (virtual assistant)
              support to systems audit and CRM implementation and everything in between. My services start at $295 AUD.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is a sufficient color contrast ratio?">
            <p>
              According to WCAG 2.2 AA standards, text should have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its
              background for regular text, and 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold). For non-text elements like icons
              or buttons, a minimum ratio of 3:1 is required. This ensures content is readable for users with visual
              impairments or color blindness.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How do I make custom components accessible?">
            <p>
              To make custom components accessible, focus on these key aspects: use semantic HTML where possible,
              implement proper keyboard support, add appropriate ARIA attributes, manage focus when needed, and ensure
              adequate color contrast. Always test with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Consider using
              established design patterns from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/"
                >ARIA Authoring Practices Guide</a
